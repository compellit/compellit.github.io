[CLARIAH-GAL](https://www.clariah.gal/) is the Galician node of CLARIAH-ES, which coordinates Spain's participation in European Resarch Infrastruture Consortia [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/) and [DARIAH](https://www.dariah.eu/). CLARIAH-GAL is managed by [Instituto da Lingua Galega](https://ilg.usc.gal/), in collaboration with CiTIUS, which is the host for the COMPEL project.
