On June 3, the [Office for Scientific Strategy](https://imaisd.usc.es/default.asp?i=en&s=) at Universidade de Santiago de Compostela organized an Information Session on the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships Call ([MSCA-2025-PF](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/HORIZON-MSCA-2025-PF-01-01)).

Loly Sánchez Santos from the Office for Scientific Strategy presented the MSCA-PF program. Then two current fellows presented their experience preparing their project proposals: Ana Rita Rodrigues Vilares, who's leading the GRAPHYRIN project at CIQUS, and Pablo Ruiz Fabo, leading the COMPEL project at CiTIUS. We had a full room with participants asking insightful questions.

USC did well at the previous calls, with 10 grants in the [2023](https://www.usc.gal/en/node/44750) call (2nd place state-wide) and 5 grants in the [2024](https://www.usc.gal/gl/xornal/novas/usc-consegue-axudas-europeas-marie-curie-situa-primeiras-institucions) call. We wish the best of luck this year again!
