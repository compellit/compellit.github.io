On April 24, the Faculty of Philosophy organized a round table on AI and complexity, with colleagues from their faculty, the Faculty of Physics and CiTIUS. The round table program is at [https://www.usc.gal/gl/xornal/eventos/mesa-redonda-ia-complexidade](https://www.usc.gal/gl/xornal/eventos/mesa-redonda-ia-complexidade).

Pablo Ruiz took part in the round table, discussing about Large Language Models and stressing that although they help solve arbitrary text interpretation tasks, like figurative language processing tasks relevant for the COMPEL project, they present challenges in terms of sustainability and result interpretability, two topics relevant for the project.
