The analysis of literary data across various languages is essential for understanding literary practices throughout history and diverse traditions. However, many languages lack adequate computational resources for literary analysis. With the support of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions programme, the **COMPEL** project will address and study Galician literature – the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages recognises the Galician language – to enhance computational literary analysis resources in lesser-studied traditions. By examining which features become standard in peripheral traditions compared to major ones, the project aims to promote inclusive literary history while contributing to European linguistic diversity goals. It advocates for European identity by facilitating smarter access to cultural heritage, aligning with current EU priorities. 

The project started on April 1, 2025. It is hosted at [CiTIUS](https://citius.gal/), the research center on intelligent technologies at [Universidade de Santiago de Compostela](https://www.usc.gal/en), with [Pablo Ruiz Fabo](https://citius.gal/team/pablo-ruiz-fabo/) as the PI and [Paulo Gamallo](https://citius.gal/team/pablo-gamallo-otero/) as supervisor.
